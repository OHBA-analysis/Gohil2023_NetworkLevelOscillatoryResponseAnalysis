Conventional Time-Frequency Analysis (Sensor Level)
---------------------------------------------------

Scripts:

- `1_epoch.py`: Epoch the sensor-level data to give 'trials'.
- `2_first_level.py`: Calculate trial averages for different events types (famous faces, unfamiliar faces, scrambled faces and button presses) for each session. This script also calculates the difference between event types (contrasts).
- `3_group_level.py`: Do statistical testing at the group-level to identify significant responses.
- `4_plot.py`: Plot results.
